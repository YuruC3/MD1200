# MD1200 fan noise reduction 

A set of scripts that automagically set fan speed on a MD1200 (probably MD1220 as well) based on internal temperature readings.

## PC

Working working working. 

So far seems to work.

## STM32F103C6T6

I think it needs a MAX2323 between MD1200.

Will look into that.

## Arduino Nano

Same here
